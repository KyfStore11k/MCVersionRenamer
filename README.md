# MCVersionRenamer
MCVersionRenamer is a fun tool designed to change your Minecraft Version visually!

## Features
- Easily rename and organize Minecraft version
- Friendly and Easy Gui
## Installation
- Download: Visit the Releases section of the repository to download the latest version.
- Setup: Put the `mcversionrenamer-<latest-release-version>.jar` into your `mods` folder of your Fabric installation.
- Run Minecraft: Pretty simple, just run Minecraft.

## (IMPORTANT!)
MCVersionRenamer requires a few dependencies to work (some dependencies may be shaded later once I get around to that):
- Fabric API: https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api
- MCVersionRenamer: https://github.com/KyfStore11k/MCVersionRenamer/releases (PS: This is the mod your viewing right now!)

MCVersionRenamer also recommends a few dependencies:
- ModMenu: https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu
- BetterF3: https://modrinth.com/mod/betterf3

## External Mod Notes

### BetterF3:

(*For BetterF3, you will **HAVE** to install Mod Menu!*) Begin by opening the `Mods` tab, and edit the BetterF3 config settings. Select `Left Modules` and delete the `Minecraft Module`. Next press `Add New Module` and add the `MCVersionRenamer Custom Version Text` module. If it appears at the bottom, just scroll down, and press the up arrow until it reaches the top of the list. Finally, save the config settings and exit. When you play Minecraft now, it should be updated to the MCVersionRenamer custom version text that you set.
