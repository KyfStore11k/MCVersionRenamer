## External Mod Notes

### FancyMenu:

FancyMenu (as of now) currently has half-implemented functionality.
I will be attempting to fix the scenario in which if `Current Screen Customization` is enabled,
it will overwrite MCVersionRenamer's custom version text
(TitleScreen only).

## Working On (*Not Implemented*)
- A complete FancyMenu hook for MCVersionRenamer!
- More optimizations!
